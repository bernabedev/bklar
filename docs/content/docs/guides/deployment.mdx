# Deployment

Bklar apps are just Bun apps. You can deploy them anywhere Bun is supported.

## Docker

The most robust way to deploy is using Docker.

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM oven/bun:1 as base
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install dependencies
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile --production

# Copy source
COPY . .

# Run
USER bun
EXPOSE 3000/tcp
ENTRYPOINT [ "bun", "run", "src/index.ts" ]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t my-api .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-api
```

## Railway / Render

Platforms like Railway and Render support Bun natively.

1. Connect your GitHub repository.
2. Set the **Build Command** to `bun install`.
3. Set the **Start Command** to `bun run src/index.ts`.

## VPS (Ubuntu/Debian)

If managing your own server:

1. Install Bun: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
2. Clone your repo.
3. Install deps: `bun install --production`
4. Use a process manager like PM2 (Bun works well with it):

```bash
bun add -g pm2
pm2 start src/index.ts --name "api" --interpreter ~/.bun/bin/bun
```
