# Getting Started

Bklar is designed to be up and running instantly. The best way to start a new project is using our official CLI tool.

## Automatic Installation

We recommend using `bun create` to scaffold your project. It provides interactive templates for different use cases.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run the CLI
    
    Open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    bun create bklar my-app
    ```

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Choose a Template
    
    The interactive wizard will ask you to choose a template:
    
    - **Minimal:** A single file setup. Great for microservices.
    - **Modular:** A structured setup with folders for routes and controllers.
    - **Custom:** Select specific plugins (CORS, JWT, Swagger, etc.) manually.
  </Step>
 
  <Step>
    ### Start Development
    
    Navigate to your new project and start the server:

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    bun run dev
    ```

    Your server will be listening at `http://localhost:3000`.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to build from scratch, you can install the core package manually.

<Tabs items={["Bun", "NPM", "PNPM"]}>
  <Tab value="Bun">```bash bun add bklar zod ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="NPM">```bash npm install bklar zod ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="PNPM">```bash pnpm add bklar zod ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Note:** `zod` is a required peer dependency for validation.

### Hello World

Create an `index.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Bklar } from "bklar";

const app = Bklar();

app.get("/", (ctx) => {
  return ctx.text("Hello from Bklar! 🐰");
});

app.listen(3000);
```

```

```
