# Welcome to your new bklar Project 🐰

This project was generated by `bklar`. It provides a minimal starting point for building fast and modern APIs with the [bklar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bklar) framework.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Your project is all set up. To get your server running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**

    If you didn't do this during the setup wizard, open your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server**

    Now, start your server in watch mode:

    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```

Your server is now running and listening at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🛠️ Next Steps

Now that your server is running, here are a few things you can do:

- **Modify the Entrypoint:** Open `index.ts` and start adding your own routes and logic. This is the heart of your application.

- **Explore the Documentation:** For a full guide on features like routing, validation, and middlewares, check out the official [bklar documentation](https://github.com/bernabedev/bklar#readme).

- **Add More Plugins:** You can easily add official plugins at any time. For example, to add JWT support:
  ```bash
  bun add @bklarjs/jwt
  ```
